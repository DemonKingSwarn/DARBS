# Demon's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Script (DARBS)

## Installation:

On an Arch-based distribution as root, run the following:
```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/DemonKingSwarn/DARBS/raw/master/darbs.sh
sh darbs.sh
```
That's it.

## What is DARBS?

DARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

DARBS can run on a fresh install of Arch Linux, and provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization.
